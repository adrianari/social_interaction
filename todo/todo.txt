# Research Question:

  - Problem identification:
      What is driving my curiosity? What am I interested in?
      Where do I see problems?
      Can I investigate it?
      Is it manageable with my resources and time?
      
  - Question Development:
      Do I want to explore, describe or explain the problem?
      What needs to be known to solve the problem?
      What is unknown? 
      How can I narrow it down to a researchable question?
      
  - Data considerations and collection:
      (X) What data do I need? Who has the data I need? How do I get it?
      Will my operationalisation really measure what I want?
      
  - Research Methods:
      What methods have others used?
      Is my method suitable to answer my research question?
      What assumptions do I implicitly or explicitly make, and are they reasonable?
      Will others trust in my method / is it as simple as possible?
      
  - Data analysis:
      What is the effect ofâ€¦?
      Are there confounding factors?
      Are my findings robust?
      
  - Conclusion:
      What do my findings tell me?
      Do my findings answer my research question?
      How can my research in`luence future research?

A good (quantitative) research question...
  * asks about the relationship between two or more variables
  * is stated clearly and in the form of a single question
  * takes part in a scienti`ic discussion
  * is testable (i.e. possible to collect data which allows to answer the question)
  * is specific and restricted in scope
  * is relevant


# Network:
What does the network look like: what are the nodes, what are the connections?


# Research Design:
Design how the research question can be answered (strategy, data, methods)


# Data:


# Presentation:
Present your question, design and `indings in a 15-min presentation in the last session of the course.
