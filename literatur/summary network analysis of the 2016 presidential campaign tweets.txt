# Summary Network Analysis of the 2016 Presidential Campaign Tweets


## Dataset

* 27'000 Tweets from Trump's Twitter (unstemmed terms = 14'300) -> 300 base terms were selected that occured in the entire corpus at least 100 times

* grouping of tweets by months into 48 tweets corpora --> conversion into network

* 1 node = monthly corpus

* connection by weighted edge (correlation of the base term frequencies in the corresponding corpora)



## Network of Tweets

* Louvain community detection algorithm

* 4 distinct node clusters (nodes per cluster form a temporal continuum)

* average number of tweets per corpus decreased over time 

* lack of correlation between December 2017 and January 2017
  underlying hypothesis: discontinuity due to unanticipated resistance from the judicial and legislatiev branches

* the well-structured, quasi-linera network of monthly Trump Tweet corpora matches the presidential election campaign's calender stages



## Topic Extraction

* hypothesis: Hilary Clinton was in the defensive position thorughout the campaign and had to respond to Trump's challenges, rather than form her agenda on Twitter

* basis = cross-correlation between the major presidential candidates tweet

* extraction of hashtags and rare and significant words ( + bi- and trigrams). 
  (Rare = not in the COCA or frequency is less than 25 times mean(COCA); 
   Significant = occurs at least 10 times + frequency higher than 25 times mean(COCA)

* per candidate and per each biweekly subcorpus --> 287 semantic networks where
  nodes = terms
  edge weight = co-occurence in the same tweet

* Louvain algorithm

--> result = 2518 subtopics overall in total


* combining these subtopics that have a significant word overlap by constructing a weighted network of subtopics

* node = subtopic

* edge weight = Jaccard index

* Louvain algorithm

--> result = 17 reoccuring subtopics for all candidates and periods (vgl. Seite 4 des PDFs für die genaue Übersicht der Resultate)
